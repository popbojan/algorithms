 * Exercise 1.3.12:
 * Write an iterable Stack client that has a static method copy() that takes a stack of stings as argument
 * and returns a copy of the stack. Note: This ability is a prime example of the value of having an iterator,
 * because it allows development of such functionality without changing the basic API.
