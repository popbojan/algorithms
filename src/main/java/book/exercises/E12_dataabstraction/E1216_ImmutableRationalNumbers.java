/**
 * Rational numbers. Implement an immutable data type Rational for rational numbers
 * that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
 * <p>
 * public class Rational
 * Rational(int numerator, int denominator)
 * Rational plus(Rational b) sum of this number and b
 * Rational minus(Rational b) difference of this number and b
 * Rational times(Rational b) product of this number and b
 * Rational divides(Rational b) quotient of this number and b
 * boolean equals(Rational that) is this number equal to that?
 * String toString() string representation
 * <p>
 * You do not have to worry about testing for overflow (seee EXERCISE 1.2.17), but use as
 * instance variables two long values that represent the numerator and denominator to
 * limit the possibility of overflow. Use Euclid's algorith (see page 4) to ensure that the
 * numerator and denominator never have any common factors. Include a test client that
 * exercises all of your methods.
